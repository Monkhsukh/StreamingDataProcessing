# StreamingDataProcessing

Here, This repo will summarize the streaming book, called Streaming Systems The What, Where, When, and How of Large-Scale Data Processing
by Tyler Akidau, Slava Chernyak, and Reuven Lax.

The book provides examples with implementation codes written in Java language. Hence, in this repo, Python version of code will be implemented.

## Streaming 

Streaming system is the engine designed with infinite dataset. However, the dataset shape differs two categories.

* Bounded data - A type of dataset that is finite in size
* Unbounded data - A type of dataset that is infinite size

These are called cardinality. Constitution of dataset, its physical manifestation. The way interact with data.
